# Starship Salvage: Cosmic Run - Game Rules

## Overview
Starship Salvage is a two-player card game where players command starships and battle each other while managing resources, conducting tech research, and performing tactical maneuvers.

## Setup
- Each player starts with:
  - 15 Hull points
  - A starter deck containing:
    - 7 Engineers (2♣)
    - 3 Marines (2♠)
- A shared Derelict Cache (standard 52-card deck) is created
- A Tech Bay is set up with 5 random cards from the Derelict Cache

## Card Types and Values
- Standard playing cards are used (2-Ace)
- Face values:
  - Number cards (2-10): Value equals the number
  - Jack (J): 5 points
  - Queen (Q): 6 points
  - King (K): 7 points
  - Ace (A): 8 points

## Turn Structure

### 1. Draw Phase
- Draw 5 cards at the start of your turn
- If deck is empty, shuffle discard pile into deck

### 2. Action Phase
For each card in hand, you can choose to play it as either:
- **Resource**: Add points equal to card's face value to your Salvage Points
- **Maneuver**: Perform a suit-specific action:
  - **Clubs (Engineer)**: Draw 1 card immediately
  - **Diamonds (Scientist)**: Look at top 3 cards of Derelict Cache, choose 1 to add to hand
  - **Hearts (Medic)**: Schedule hull repair
  - **Spades (Marine)**: Schedule attack

### 3. Purchase Phase
- Use Salvage Points to buy one tech card from the Tech Bay
- Cost equals the card's face value
- Purchased cards go to your discard pile
- Any remaining Salvage Points convert to Shield (temporary protection)

### 4. Combat & End Phase
- **Attack Resolution**: 
  - Marine maneuvers create combo attacks
  - First Marine = 1 damage, second = 2 damage, etc.
  - Total damage = (number of Marines × (number of Marines + 1)) ÷ 2
  - Opponent's Shield absorbs damage first, then Hull
- **Repair Resolution**:
  - One Medic = 1 repair
  - Each additional Medic adds +2 repair
- **End of Turn**:
  - Discard all remaining cards from hand
  - Shield resets at start of next turn

## Special Mechanics

### Shield System
- Temporary protection that lasts until your next turn
- Absorbs damage before Hull
- Resets at the start of each turn

### Tech Bay
- Contains 5 random cards from Derelict Cache
- Refills automatically when cards are purchased
- Cards can be bought using Salvage Points

### Derelict Cache
- Shared pool of cards
- Used for tech searches and refilling Tech Bay
- When empty, discards are shuffled back in

## Victory Conditions
- Game ends when either player's Hull reaches 0
- Last player with Hull remaining wins
- If both players reach 0 Hull simultaneously, it's a draw
