Archetype Card Mappings and Combo Systems in Arcane Shuffle
Arcane Shuffle's five archetypes utilize distinct card value/suit mappings and poker hand mechanics to create varied tactical experiences. Below is the comprehensive breakdown of each archetype's card interactions, combo systems, and strategic depth.

1. The Cultivator (Ramp Archetype)
Suit Affinity: Clubs (resource growth) & Spades (persistent effects)

Card Value Mechanics
2–5: Generate bonus mana crystals when played (e.g., 2♣ = +1 mana next turn; 5♠ = +2 mana permanently)

6–10: Summon "Growth Tokens" that provide escalating bonuses (e.g., 7♣ = +1 mana/turn for 3 turns)

Face Cards:

Jack: Double current mana for one turn

Queen: Permanently increase mana cap by 1

King: Play all Growth Tokens immediately

Ace: Reset all card costs to 0 for one turn

Poker Hand Combos
Flush (5♣): Gain 3 mana crystals and draw 2 cards

Full House: Summon an indestructible "Eldertree" (5/10 stats) that generates +2 mana/turn

Straight: Reduce the cost of all cards in hand by 2

Example Play:
A player chains 3♣, 5♠, and 7♣ to accelerate mana gain, then triggers a Flush with 2♣/4♣/6♣ to fuel a King♦️ play for a massive late-game board.

2. The Berserker (Aggro Archetype)
Suit Affinity: Hearts (direct damage) & Diamonds (burst effects)

Card Value Mechanics
2–5: Deal damage equal to card value (e.g., 3♥ = 3 damage; 5♦️ = 5 damage + discard 1 card)

6–10: Overload effects (e.g., 8♥ = 8 damage but skip next draw phase)

Face Cards:

Jack: Deal 10 damage but take 5 damage

Queen: Triple damage of next attack

King: Deal 15 damage to opponent and self

Ace: Ignite all cards in hand (discard them for +2 damage each)

Poker Hand Combos
Three-of-a-Kind: Double damage of all cards played this turn

Pair: Draw 1 card and reduce its cost by 3

Royal Flush: Instantly reduce opponent’s health by 25%

Example Play:
A Berserker plays 4♦️ + 4♥ to trigger a Pair (drawing Queen♦️), then uses Queen♦️ to amplify a King♥️ for 45 total damage.

3. The Mystic (Control Archetype)
Suit Affinity: Diamonds (spell synergy) & Spades (card advantage)

Card Value Mechanics
2–5: Counter spells (e.g., 3♦️ = Negate next card under 4 mana)

6–10: Draw/discard manipulation (e.g., 7♠ = Opponent discards 2 cards)

Face Cards:

Jack: Copy the last spell played

Queen: Shuffle opponent’s hand into their deck

King: Freeze all enemy minions for 3 turns

Ace: Reset the board to its state 2 turns prior

Poker Hand Combos
Straight Flush: Lock opponent out of playing cards for 1 turn

Four-of-a-Kind: Steal 3 random cards from opponent’s deck

Flush: Reduce all spell costs by 4 next turn

Example Play:
A Mystic counters a Berserker’s King♥️ with 5♦️, then plays a Straight (6♦️/7♦️/8♦️) to seal the opponent’s mana for a critical turn.

4. The Trickster (Disruption Archetype)
Suit Affinity: Clubs (tactics) & Hearts (sacrifice)

Card Value Mechanics
2–5: Force discards (e.g., 2♣ = Opponent discards 1 card)

6–10: Life-swap effects (e.g., 8♣ = Swap health totals for 1 turn)

Face Cards:

Jack: Steal 2 mana from opponent

Queen: Destroy a random card in opponent’s hand

King: Swap hands with opponent

Ace: Reshuffle all cards into decks and redraw 5

Poker Hand Combos
Two Pair: Drain 5 health per card in opponent’s hand

Full House: Force opponent to play their next card face-up

High Card (Ace): Reflect all damage taken this turn

Example Play:
A Trickster uses 3♣ + 3♥ to drain 6 health, then activates King♣ to swap hands and disrupt a Commander’s synergy setup.

5. The Commander (Synergy Archetype)
Suit Affinity: Hearts (unity) & Spades (resilience)

Card Value Mechanics
2–5: Summon "Squire" tokens (1/1 stats)

6–10: Buff all tokens (e.g., 7♥ = +2/+2 to all Squires)

Face Cards:

Jack: Resurrect all tokens destroyed this turn

Queen: Give all tokens "Attack: Draw 1 card"

King: Transform tokens into 5/5 Champions

Ace: Double the stats of all tokens

Poker Hand Combos
Pair: Give all tokens +1/+1

Three-of-a-Kind: Summon a "War Banner" (aura: +1/+1 to all tokens)

Flush: All tokens gain lifesteal

Example Play:
A Commander floods the board with 2♥/3♥/4♥ Squires, triggers a Pair for +2/+2, then plays Queen♥️ to draw 3 cards off attacks.

Balance and Replayability Considerations
Cultivator vs. Berserker: Cultivators use Clubs/Spades to outpace Berserkers’ early Hearts/Diamonds aggression but crumble if disrupted early.

Mystic vs. Trickster: Mystics counter Tricksters’ disruption with Diamonds/Spades card advantage but struggle against Commanders’ token swarms.

Commander Weakness: Vulnerable to Trickster’s Full House combo that reveals their strategy preemptively.

By tying poker mechanics to archetype-specific strategies, Arcane Shuffle ensures no two matches play identically while maintaining balance through asymmetric card mappings
