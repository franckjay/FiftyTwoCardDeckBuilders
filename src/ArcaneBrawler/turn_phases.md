Detailed Turn Phases in Arcane Shuffle
Each turn in Arcane Shuffle is divided into distinct phases that allow players to manage resources, play cards, summon creatures, and engage in combat. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the turn structure, including rules for playing creatures and spells, attacking, blocking, and resolving combat.

1. Beginning Phase
The start of the turn where players prepare their board state.

Steps:
Untap Step: Untap all tapped cards (creatures, tokens, or effects). These cards are now ready to act again.

Upkeep Step: Resolve any abilities or effects that trigger "at the beginning of your turn" (e.g., mana generation from Cultivator Growth Tokens).

Draw Step: Draw one card from your deck. On the first turn of the game, the starting player skips this step.

2. Main Phase 1
This is the first opportunity to play cards, summon creatures, and cast spells.

Rules for Playing Cards:
Mana Usage: Players spend mana crystals to play cards. Each card costs mana equal to its value (e.g., 4♥ costs 4 mana).

Creatures:

Creatures are summoned by playing cards with creature effects (e.g., Commander tokens or Berserker direct attackers).

Creatures enter the battlefield with "summoning sickness," meaning they cannot attack until your next turn unless specified otherwise.

Spells:

Spells include instant effects (played at any time) and sorcery effects (played only during your main phase).

Example: Mystic spells like countering opponent actions or Trickster spells disrupting their hand.

Poker Combos:

Players may play combinations of cards (pairs, straights, flushes, etc.) to trigger archetype-specific combo effects.

Combos consume mana equal to the total cost of all cards in the combo.

3. Combat Phase
The action-packed phase where players attack and defend using creatures.

Steps:
Beginning of Combat:

Players may use instants or abilities before declaring attackers (e.g., Mystic counterspells or Berserker buffs).

No new creatures can be summoned during this phase.

Declare Attackers:

The active player chooses which creatures will attack and taps them.

Attackers target either the opponent directly or their creatures/tokens.

Abilities like Berserker's burst damage or Commander’s token buffs can modify attacks.

Declare Blockers:

The defending player chooses which creatures will block incoming attacks.

Blockers do not tap but must already be untapped at the start of combat.

If a creature blocks an attacker with equal or greater power, both creatures are destroyed unless otherwise specified.

Combat Resolution:

Damage is calculated based on attacking and blocking creatures' power and toughness.

Example: A 5/3 attacker versus a 3/5 blocker results in both being destroyed.

Unblocked attackers deal damage directly to the opponent's health points.

Archetype-specific abilities may trigger during combat resolution (e.g., Commander lifesteal effects).

4. Main Phase 2
A second opportunity to play cards after combat.

Rules:
Players can summon additional creatures, cast spells, or activate abilities during this phase.

This phase is often used to recover from combat losses or set up defenses for the next turn.

5. End Phase
The conclusion of a turn where lingering effects are resolved.

Steps:
Cleanup Step:

All temporary effects that last "until end of turn" expire (e.g., Berserker damage buffs).

Discard Step:

If a player has more than seven cards in hand, they must discard down to seven.

Opponent's Turn Begins:

The next player becomes active and begins their turn.

Special Rules for Creatures and Combat
Summoning Creatures
Creatures enter with summoning sickness unless explicitly stated otherwise (e.g., Berserker "Haste" abilities).

Creatures remain on the battlefield until destroyed by combat damage or card effects.

Attacking
Attackers deal damage equal to their power (card value) to either opponents or blocking creatures.

Archetype-specific mechanics influence attacks:

Berserker attackers deal bonus damage but may recoil damage onto themselves.

Commander attackers gain lifesteal when buffed by synergy combos.

Blocking
Blockers absorb incoming damage based on their toughness (card value).

Archetypes like Mystic may use spells during blocking steps to negate attackers entirely.

Combat Abilities
Instant abilities can be played during combat steps (e.g., Mystic counterspells or Trickster disruption tactics).

Archetypes like Cultivator may summon Growth Tokens mid-combat as reinforcements.

Example Turn Flow
Player A (Cultivator) vs Player B (Berserker):
Beginning Phase:

Player A untaps Growth Tokens generating +2 mana crystals.

Player B resolves an ability that deals 2 damage at the start of their turn.

Main Phase 1:

Player A summons a Sapling Token using 7♠ and plays Queen♣ to increase max mana cap by +1.

Player B plays King♥ for a massive direct attack spell dealing 15 damage but takes 5 recoil damage.

Combat Phase:

Player A attacks with Sapling Token boosted by Flush combo (+3/+3 stats).

Player B blocks using a creature summoned earlier but loses it due to insufficient toughness.

Main Phase 2:

Player A plays Ace♠ resetting all card costs for one turn.

Player B uses Queen♦️ to triple damage on their next attack spell.

End Phase:

Temporary buffs expire; both players discard excess cards if needed.
