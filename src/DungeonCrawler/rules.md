  - **Clubs (Dagger)**: Deal quick damage (half face value)
  - **Diamonds (Potion)**: Heal self or ally

### 3. Monster Phase
- Current monster deals damage to both players
- If monster is defeated, draw a new one from Monster Deck
- If no monster is present, draw a new one

### 4. Treasure Phase

- Cost equals the card's face value
- Purchased cards go to your discard pile
- Any remaining Gold converts to temporary Health (max 5)

### 5. End Phase
